## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)

In order to solve problems, deliver outstanding work or just to work focussed and concentrated on a task requires to voluntarily direct attention. 
According to Kaplan, S.(1995), this focus of attention, the deliberate mental activity in the face of (negatively impacting) distraction requires effort and is suspectible to fatigue. 
Directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and achievments and therefore its fatigue can have severe consequences (e.g. airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, brain surgeons).

(Add real-world examples, if any)

There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. But it has much broader real live implications. Directed or focussed attention is needed for most of our daily activities, even in the university as a student. While not being vital per definition, the ability to work in a concentrated fashion to deliver outstanding work decides over students grades and therfore also at least partly over their/our future. Recovery from directed attention fatigue restores effectiveness, which will have an immediate impacts of the overall, general live situation (better, more effective time management).  

(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The observation of "voluntary attention", its effects and needs were first descibed by William James (1892). Since then the theory and research have been on hold until about 1985. Most current research was done by Stephen Kaplan.  

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

Acknowledging that directed attention is highly important and that this process is suspectible to fatigue, how can it be restored?

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

Improving effectiveness, restoring focus and improving the ability to inhibit distractions is self explainatory.  

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

In the context of restoring attention and relieving stress, viewing or immersing in nature has repeatedly shown positive effects. Our research aims at validating/reconstructing some of the more recent research by using nature scenes under Virtual Reality.

The article under review was The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting with Nature by Marc Berman, John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan in the journal of Psychological Science. The purpose of this experiment was to validate the Attention Restoration Theory which states that interacting with nature will restore ones ability to focus specifically direct attention. Early in the article the authors use other references to use their frameworks and apply it in a different setting to be validated. To be more specific the authors hypothesis was walking in nature or looking at a photo of nature will improve directed-attention abilities as measured with a backwards digit-span task and the Attention Network Task, thus validating attention restoration theory. Lastly, Students from the university of Michigan, 23 females, 15 males, average age 22.62 years, and all participants were paid $20
	The methodology for Experiment 1 is as follows. Participants were given the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to assess current mood, then asked to repeat sequences of numbers ranging from 3 to 9 backwards. After the backwards digit-spanning task the participants were given a directed-forgetting task that involved the suppression of information in short-term memory, which was used to fatigue participants further. The task consisted of 144 trials and lasted for 35 min. The participants were then randomly picked to take a nature walk or urban walk for 50 to 55mins, and a GPS tracker were given to the participants to ensure they were in the right setting. After the walks the participants were given the backwards digit-spanning task again along with the PANAS assessment, finishing the experiment.A week later participants were given the same procedure again, while walking in a complimentary position.
	The methodology for experiment 2 is as follows.  Participants were given the PANAS, and the backwards digit-spanning task as in experiments 1. In contrast to experiment 1, the participants were given the Attention Network Test(ANT) which identifies three different attentional functions: Alerting, Orientating, and Executive Attention. (We predicted that interactions with nature would improve only executive functions, but not alerting and orienting, because these latter two functions require less cognitive control compared to executive functions). After the ANT, participants were shown pictures of either nature scenes or urban city scenes for 10mins, where each photo was shown for 7s. After each photo the participant rated from 1 to 3 how much they liked the photo. Once finished with all of the phots, the participants performs the backwards digit-spanning task, the ANT, and the PANAS assessments again. The participants came a week later to repeat the procedure but with complimentary photos.
	The setting of the research was taken place in the researchers office/lab at the University of Michigan, and when on walks the Ann Arbor Downtown and the Ann Arbor Arboretum areas. The data collected can be seen below in Figure 1.

                                                  Figure 1
	From looking at the Experiment 1’s results the values are both higher after the walks but the natural setting is higher in the Backward Span Measure. In experiment 2 the results closely followed for the Backward span measure. Additionally looking at the ANT measure effects there were some mixed results, although the authors hypothesized only the executive functions would decrease in the participants in the natural setting. The participants in the urban setting actually took longer on their executive and alerting levels. This study accomplished its objectives and can be seen from the experiment results. In experiment 1 as participants in the natural setting vastly improved their results after their walk vs the urban setting participants. Additionally in experiments 2 the authors repeated the studies in experiment 1 and the results were replicated. Lastly the ANT measures show that after the participants view photos of natural settings their executive cognitions increase. This is because directed attention involves executive tasks and can be restored through ART methods.The authors concluded that they “can be confident that directed-attention mechanisms were restored in these studies because only portions of the ANT that involved directed attention were improved by interactions with nature”. They also noted each of the experiments showed “consistent improvement on the backwards digit-span task as a function of interactions with nature”.
	The authors point out at the end other comparison methods that also restores the directed attention. I think a third and fourth set could of been looked at. For example adding someone who meditates after the first assessments, and assess them after they have meditated and see how the compared to those in nature. Also agree that their conclusions are reasonable because their results and research design was concise at addressing the hypothesis. The researchers made sure to have truthful data to analyze when they were performing experiments. Additionally they performed the 2nd experiment different from actually being in nature and instead looking at a photo. This helps to see that the setting doesn’t matter but possibly the participants perception as participants for the natural and urban settings were just sitting in chairs looking at the respective photos. Either or it is the direct influence of Nature that seems to have a restorative effect and through their experiments and results this can be seen.
