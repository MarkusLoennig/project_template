## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)

In order to solve problems, deliver outstanding work or just to work focused and concentrated on a task requires to voluntarily direct attention. According to Kaplan (1995) and his Attention Restoration Theory (ART), this focus of attention, the deliberate mental activity in the face of (negatively impacting) distraction requires effort and is susceptible to fatigue. Directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and achievements and therefore its fatigue can have severe consequences (e.g. airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, brain surgeons).

Several studies based on ART have shown the positive effects that nature and/or nature scenes can have on measured attention and even stress. In one of the latest studies, performed by Anderson et al. (2017), significant positive attention restoration was measured after 15 minutes exposures to different nature scenes (Ireland, Beach) compared to the control scene results.

(Add real-world examples, if any)

There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. But it has much broader real live implications. Directed or focused attention is needed for most of our daily activities, even in the university as a student. While not being vital per definition, the ability to work in a concentrated fashion to deliver outstanding work decides over students’ grades and therefore also at least partly over their/our future. Recovery from directed attention fatigue restores effectiveness, which will have an immediate impact of the overall, general live situation (better, more effective time management).
  

(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The observation of "voluntary attention", its effects and needs were first descibed by William James (1892). Since then the theory and research have been on hold until about 1985. Most current research was done by Stephen Kaplan. One of the latest studies by Berman aim to validated the Attention Restoration Theory in Nature where participants in nature or viewing pictures of nature reduced their direct attention levels. Today's proposed solutions are pairing this theory with VR methodology, since VR is becoming more accessible. Additionally VR's immercive envirnment could effect attentino restoration in positive ways by simulation Nature in VR. 


(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)
Everything today is extremely faced paced with data and information everywhere. Too much information can overload our systems, and as a result stresses us out. This stress can result from the inability to focus and people of today have developed many methods coping with stress and their ability to pay attention at the task at hand. Studies have shown that when participants surround themselves in Nature or view photos of Nature, this restores the users attention abilities compared to urban areas. This study aims to finding an optimal time when participants view nature settings under VR. 

Acknowledging that directed attention is highly important and that this process is suspectible to fatigue, how can it be restored?

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

Improving effectiveness, restoring focus and improving the ability to inhibit distractions is self explainatory. Additionally other studies have not looked at the timing it takes for one to relax, just in the variables themselves. From previous studies the ART method has been validated, and so the next question is how long does it take for one to be in a relaxed state.

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

In the context of restoring attention and relieving stress, viewing or immersing in nature has repeatedly shown positive effects. Our research aims at validating/reconstructing some of the more recent research by using nature scenes under Virtual Reality.

## Related Work

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

The article under review was The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting with Nature by Marc Berman, John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan in the journal of Psychological Science. The purpose of this experiment was to validate the Attention Restoration Theory which states that interacting with nature will restore ones ability to focus specifically direct attention. The authors hypothesis was that walking in nature or looking at a photo of nature will improve directed-attention abilities.

The design of the experimentation was simple pre assessment then for experiment 1 the participants were either told to go for a walk in the downtown area or walk in the arboretum on the universities campus for 50-55 minutes. The assessments used were the PANAS and the backwards digit span assessments for the first experiments. The PANAS assessed mood, and the backwards digit span test for participants direction attention abilities. After the walk the participants were given the backwards digit span task again. Once the final assessment was over the participants returned a week later and performed the same experiment again.

Alternatively another experiment was performed with slightly different design. The only different was the that the backwards digit span assessment wasn’t used to measure direct attention abilities, rather the Attention Network Test(ANT). This assessment measures the participants executive, alerting, and orientating functions. Additionally instead of walking through either an urban area or in nature, the participants were shown either urban or nature scene photos.

This study accomplished its objectives and can be seen from the experiment results. In experiment 1 as participants in the natural setting vastly improved their results after their walk vs the urban setting participants. Additionally in experiments 2 the authors repeated the studies in experiment 1 and the results were replicated. Lastly the ANT measures show that after the participants view photos of natural settings their executive cognitions increase. This is because directed attention involves executive tasks and can be restored through ART methods.The authors concluded that they “can be confident that directed-attention mechanisms were restored in these studies because only portions of the ANT that involved directed attention were improved by interactions with nature”. They also noted each of the experiments showed “consistent improvement on the backwards digit-span task as a function of interactions with nature”.

Another report discusses the results of a study conducted using Attention Restoration Theory (ART) delivered through Virtual Reality (VR), 18 subjects took part in this study, 9 males and 9 females between the ages of 20 and 44. During this study, a head mounted display device such as the Oculus VR was used to immerse the subjects into three different scenes, one rural scene without any nature settings and two other nature scenes. This study posed 2 hypotheses, the first one claimed that nature scenes can reduce stress better than non-nature scenes, while the second hypothesis stated that the preference of the nature scene will have more restorative results than the other nature scene. Several devices were used to record stress level activity, questionnaires were also used to assess the perception the subject’s perception of their own stress level. During the experiment the subjects wore the monitoring the devices to create a baseline, then a timed math test was provided to induce a certain stress level on the subjects, after raising the stress level, the subjects were placed under the VR scenes for 15 minutes. This process was repeated again with all of the other scenes and the order of the scenes were randomized. The monitoring devices recorded stress level throughout the whole experiment, while the questionnaires were provided to the subject before and after the VR sessions. The study produced results in accordance with the first hypothesis. The subject displayed and expressed that after being stressed, the natural scene relieved stress more significantly than the non-nature scene. On the other hand, the second hypothesis did not show a significant difference between the nature scene of choice and the other nature scene according to the monitoring sensors, but according to the perception of the subjects it did.

	
## Research Methods
Since the subject is interdisciplinary by design, there are certain areas in which each member has only very limited knowledge about. 
The first step of our research was a rough literature research about the different topics and for related and similar work and studies. This led to the current research question, resulting in our research approach and design.  

We have chosen a quantitative approach.

Our methods and experimental design will focus on generating and gathering quantitative data. We have chosen this approach because we believe quantitative data is easier and more comprehensive to be collected, analyzed, interpreted and visualized. Additionally, the related work has shown that qualitative data is not needed to measure/generate the intended data.

Our research question (tbc) is: What is the minimum time for viewing nature scenes to have a (measurable, significant) positive effect on attention restoration, as described in the Attention Restoration Theory (ART).

#### Our experiment will be structured as following:

_The first and most important assumption of our experiment set-up is that ART works and that Attention can be restored with the use of nature scences.
We will not have a control group which will watch urban scences or just have a break (same length of time) inside the laboratory. This could be another experiment and/or be a follow up consideration._


- The set up of the experiment will be explained, a short brief on all the following meausurements and the technology used (VR) will be given.
- The participant are then given a survey on their current mood/behavior and subjective stress level, with quantitative responses (e.g. scale from 1-5) 


- The participant will then perform, as the first experiment, an Attention Network Test (ANT) 
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error
   - this is the beginning of the experiment and the results will be the baseline for all further measurements. 
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)


- It will be directly followed by other attention intensive (requiring hgh concentration levels to be successful) experiments, it will not be mentioned as something significant for the testing.
   - Digit Span Forward / Backward Test, Search and Memory Task Test, Sustained Atteintion to Response Tests
   - the intention of these tests is to wear/tire the attentive capability of the participant
   - the results will be recorded and will be given to the participant, but they will NOT be used in the experimental data
   - the overall time of the testing will be about (tbd) 30 minutes, as a compromise between the need to tire the attention of the participant and the time available with/for each participant (volunteers). 


- The participant will then again perform an Attention Network Test (ANT) as part of their tasks.
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error again, as the measurement of the effects of attention depletion
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)


- The participant will then be able to watch 15 minutes of VR nature scenes
   - The regular "office" chair will be given, as we focus on the visual inputs and effects, not the overall effect of comfortable sensory (touch, body position) environment.


- Immediatly after the scene viewing, the participant will perform the ANT again
   - we will measure a.) Reaction Time and b.) Error again, to measure the effects of possible VR attention restoration (target data!)
   - this is the baseline for the follow up session, in which the time of VR scene viewing will be reduced (to 10 minutes)
   - this is quantitative data (time, error rate)
   
   
- The participant are then again given the mood/behavior and subjective stress level survey. (quantitative responses).


_As a prerequisite to continue the experiment, the results of the first experiment need to be analyzed to make a decision!_

_The participants will need to show positive effects on their ANT._

_Otherwise the experiment has failed and needs to be re-evaluated (set-up, assumptions, execution, environment)._


- The experiment will be repeated after one week (tbd) with a shorter viewing time, reducing the VR recovery from 15 min to 10 minutes.

In addition we plan to analyze the data using the proper tools (tbi), possibly using code R to visualize results.
