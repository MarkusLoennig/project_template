## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)

In order to solve problems, deliver outstanding work or just to work focussed and concentrated on a task requires to voluntarily direct attention. 
According to Kaplan, S.(1995), this focus of attention, the deliberate mental activity in the face of (negatively impacting) distraction requires effort and is suspectible to fatigue. 
Directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and achievments and therefore its fatigue can have severe consequences (e.g. airplane pilots, nuclear power plant operators, brain surgeons).

(Add real-world examples, if any)

There are several areas where directed attention is vital, be it in medicine, engineering or piloting, just to name a few. But it has much broader real live implications. Directed or focussed attention is needed for most of our daily activities, even in the university as a student. While not being vital per definition, the ability to work in a concentrated fashion to deliver outstanding work decides over students grades and therfore also at least partly over their/our future. Recovery from directed attention fatigue restores effectiveness, which will have an immediate impacts of the overall, general live situation (better, more effective time management).  

(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

The observation of "voluntary attention", its effects and needs were first descibed by William James (1892). Since then the theory and research have been on hold until about 1985. Most current research was done by Stephen Kaplan.  

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

Acknowledging that directed attention is highly important and that this process is suspectible to fatigue, how can it be restored?

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

Improving effectiveness, restoring focus and improving the ability to inhibit distractions is self explainatory.  

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

In the context of restoring attention and relieving stress, viewing or immersing in nature has repeatedly shown positive effects. Our research aims at validating/reconstructing some of the more recent research by using nature scenes under Virtual Reality.
