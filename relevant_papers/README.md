* **The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework, Kaplan, S. (1995).** 

The paper points out the 2 conflicting positions in theory of stress reduction and recovery of focus/attention. Directed attention and possible fatigue are described and it is emphasized that directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and its fatigue a key ingredient in human error. The purpose of the article is to propose a framework to find an integrated theory of stress that permits a significant role for attention. The study/proposal works out the factors leading to stress as resource inadequacy or resource depletion, in which Kaplan defines attention as a more basic, underlying resource (in the context of stress theory). Both stress and attention fatigue benefit from restorative nature experiences and can help prevent both by recovery of essential resources.

#### Clarity of Exposition

Kaplans theoretical approach to a common framework needs introduction into both stress and attention theories, which is performed in a comprehensible fashion. Emphasize somehow lays on attention. The proposed framework is very generell and leaves some room for interpretation. 

#### Quality of References

The huge number of references are from a broader approach to his topic, from current dates (where applicable), relevant and help him draw the bridge with the respective research to integrate both theories.  

According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited 3495 times. 

#### Reproducibility

There is no research involved to reproduce. His theories and conclusion can be followed.

(5 best thing you ever read)

#### Explanation of Rating

The article is misleading when the title and abstract are considered: Natural environments and their effects are only emphasized or highlighted very casualy in the article (contradictory to the title). But it bluntly states that natural scences/experiences are helpful and important in restoration/recovery, without discussion. This applies to stress and attention without distinction.   


## Review

(which paper)
* **Relaxation with Immersive Natural Scenes Presented Using Virtual Reality**

(Summerize/Describe the paper in 3-5 sentences)
This study proposes 2 hypotheses based on Attention Restoration theory (ART) delivered through Virtual Reality (VR). The first hypothesis claimed that natural scenes can reduce stress better than indoor scenes, while the second hypothesis claimed that the preference of the individual for a specific natural scene will have more restorative results. 
For this study, stress was induced on the participants, then the participants were immersed through VR in three different settings, one indoor and two different natural settings. The researchers recorded physiological functions before, during and after the VR immersion. In addition to all data recorded, questionnaires were provided to the participants to assess their mood and perception.
The study yielded results according to the first hypothesis, were stress was reduced by showing a natural scene over an indoor scene. For the second hypothesis, the choice of the natural scene only had an effect on mood perception, not in physiological responses.

(Executive summary of your whole review in 2-3 sentences)
Many studies have been conducted on Attention Restoration theory (ART), but this research makes use of modeling and simulations to conduct the study. The authors do a great job at showing how similar studies have been conducted in the past and also to point out the difference on how they conduct their study. Finally, the study provided results similar to past studies regarding ART.

#### Clarity of Exposition

The authors approach for structuring the article is clear and concise. They structured the article in a way that is easy to follow by making references to past studies and how that leads into the research being conducted. They also point out the shortfalls of past studies while comparing the results from previous and current studies. 

#### Quality of References

This article contains a wide range of references, starting with the early work of ART and the leading researchers in this field, as well as recent papers in relation to the publication of the study. While this article has only being cited 6 times, it also noted that it is a recent study and I could not find other studies similar to this one. 

#### Reproducibility

The hardware and software used for VR are standard COTS products, the tools used for measuring physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG) are also readily available. In addition, all the forms and questionnaires are available online. The study can be easily reproduced with all the data provided in the article and the methods explained. 

#### Rating

4

#### Explanation of Rating

I gave this paper a 4 because the article is written in a way that is easy to follow and understand, there is a good review of past work, the methods use are easy to understand and the data provided was well structured,  the only reason why I did not give this paper a 5 is because I wasn’t able to answer whether the nature setting does relieve stress or the non-nature settings doesn’t allow for stress to be relieved.
