* **The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework, Kaplan, S. (1995).** 

The paper points out the 2 conflicting positions in theory of stress reduction and recovery of focus/attention. Directed attention and possible fatigue are described and it is emphasized that directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and its fatigue a key ingredient in human error. The purpose of the article is to propose a framework to find an integrated theory of stress that permits a significant role for attention. The study/proposal works out the factors leading to stress as resource inadequacy or resource depletion, in which Kaplan defines attention as a more basic, underlying resource (in the context of stress theory). Both stress and attention fatigue benefit from restorative nature experiences and can help prevent both by recovery of essential resources.

#### Clarity of Exposition

Kaplans theoretical approach to a common framework needs introduction into both stress and attention theories, which is performed in a comprehensible fashion. Emphasize somehow lays on attention. The proposed framework is very generell and leaves some room for interpretation. 

#### Quality of References

The huge number of references are from a broader approach to his topic, from current dates (where applicable), relevant and help him draw the bridge with the respective research to integrate both theories.  

According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited 3495 times. 

#### Reproducibility

There is no research involved to reproduce. His theories and conclusion can be followed.

#### Explanation of Rating

The article is misleading when the title and abstract are considered: Natural environments and their effects are only emphasized or highlighted very casualy in the article (contradictory to the title). But it bluntly states that natural scences/experiences are helpful and important in restoration/recovery, without discussion. This applies to stress and attention without distinction.
