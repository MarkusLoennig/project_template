* **The restorative benefits of nature: Toward an integrative framework, Kaplan, S. (1995).** 

The paper points out the 2 conflicting positions in theory of stress reduction and recovery of focus/attention. Directed attention and possible fatigue are described and it is emphasized that directed attention is a key ingredient in human effectiveness and its fatigue a key ingredient in human error. The purpose of the article is to propose a framework to find an integrated theory of stress that permits a significant role for attention. The study/proposal works out the factors leading to stress as resource inadequacy or resource depletion, in which Kaplan defines attention as a more basic, underlying resource (in the context of stress theory). Both stress and attention fatigue benefit from restorative nature experiences and can help prevent both by recovery of essential resources.

#### Clarity of Exposition

Kaplans theoretical approach to a common framework needs introduction into both stress and attention theories, which is performed in a comprehensible fashion. Emphasize somehow lays on attention. The proposed framework is very generell and leaves some room for interpretation. 

#### Quality of References

The huge number of references are from a broader approach to his topic, from current dates (where applicable), relevant and help him draw the bridge with the respective research to integrate both theories.  

According to Google Scholar, this article has been cited 3495 times. 

#### Reproducibility

There is no research involved to reproduce. His theories and conclusion can be followed. 

#### Rating

3

(1-5)
(1 awful)
(5 best thing you ever read)

#### Explanation of Rating

The article is misleading when the title and abstract are considered: Natural environments and their effects are only emphasized or highlighted very casualy in the article (contradictory to the title). But it bluntly states that natural scences/experiences are helpful and important in restoration/recovery, without discussion. This applies to stress and attention without distinction.   


## Review

(which paper)
* **Relaxation with Immersive Natural Scenes Presented Using Virtual Reality**

(Summerize/Describe the paper in 3-5 sentences)
This study proposes 2 hypotheses based on Attention Restoration theory (ART) delivered through Virtual Reality (VR). The first hypothesis claimed that natural scenes can reduce stress better than indoor scenes, while the second hypothesis claimed that the preference of the individual for a specific natural scene will have more restorative results. 
For this study, stress was induced on the participants, then the participants were immersed through VR in three different settings, one indoor and two different natural settings. The researchers recorded physiological functions before, during and after the VR immersion. In addition to all data recorded, questionnaires were provided to the participants to assess their mood and perception.
The study yielded results according to the first hypothesis, were stress was reduced by showing a natural scene over an indoor scene. For the second hypothesis, the choice of the natural scene only had an effect on mood perception, not in physiological responses.

(Executive summary of your whole review in 2-3 sentences)
Many studies have been conducted on Attention Restoration theory (ART), but this research makes use of modeling and simulations to conduct the study. The authors do a great job at showing how similar studies have been conducted in the past and also to point out the difference on how they conduct their study. Finally, the study provided results similar to past studies regarding ART.

#### Clarity of Exposition

The authors approach for structuring the article is clear and concise. They structured the article in a way that is easy to follow by making references to past studies and how that leads into the research being conducted. They also point out the shortfalls of past studies while comparing the results from previous and current studies. 

#### Quality of References

This article contains a wide range of references, starting with the early work of ART and the leading researchers in this field, as well as recent papers in relation to the publication of the study. While this article has only being cited 6 times, it also noted that it is a recent study and I could not find other studies similar to this one. 

#### Reproducibility

The hardware and software used for VR are standard COTS products, the tools used for measuring physiological responses such as heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG) are also readily available. In addition, all the forms and questionnaires are available online. The study can be easily reproduced with all the data provided in the article and the methods explained. 

#### Rating

4

#### Explanation of Rating

I gave this paper a 4 because the article is written in a way that is easy to follow and understand, there is a good review of past work, the methods use are easy to understand and the data provided was well structured,  the only reason why I did not give this paper a 5 is because I wasn’t able to answer whether the nature setting does relieve stress or the non-nature settings doesn’t allow for stress to be relieved.

## Review

# Title of Article:  The Cognitive Benefits of Interacting With Nature



### Authors: Marc Berman, John Jonides, Stephen Kaplan

### Journal Name, Volume, page #’s: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE_____




### Introduction: 
Providing background with the Attention Restoration Theory(ART). Uses other papers are references to help provide a framework specifically the difference between voluntary and involuntary attention. The authors frame this to so they can validate the theory through their experiment



### Purpose/Objective of Research:  
Perform experiments validating the Attention Restoration Theory by comparing cognitives function effects from urban and natural environments



### Research Hypothesis:
walking in nature or looking at a photo of nature will improve directed-attention abilities as measured with a backwards digit-span task and the Attention Network Task, thus validating attention restoration theory.

### Overview of Methodology:

Subject Characteristics:_Students from the university of Michigan, 23 females, 15 males, average age 22.62 years, and all participants were paid $20

### General Methodology:
#### Experiment 1
Participants were given the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) to assess current mood, then asked to repeat sequences of numbers ranging from 3 to 9 backwards. After the backwards digit-spanning task the participants were given a directed-forgetting task that involved the suppression of information in short-term memory, which was used to fatigue participants further. The task consisted of 144 trials and lasted for 35 min. The participants were then randomly picked to take a nature walk or urban walk for 50 to 55mins, and a GPS tracker were given to the participants to ensure they were in the right setting. After the walks the participants were given the backwards digit-spanning task again along with the PANAS assessment, finishing the experiment.A week later participants were given the same procedure again, while walking in a complimentary position.

#### Experiment 2:
Participants were given the PANAS, and the backwards digit-spanning task as in experiments 1. In contrast to experiment 1, the participants were given the Attention Network Test(ANT) which identifies three different attentional functions: Alerting, Orientating, and Executive Attention. (We predicted that interactions with nature would improve only executive functions, but not alerting and orienting, because these latter two functions require less cognitive control compared to executive functions). After the ANT, participants were shown pictures of either nature scenes or urban city scenes for 10mins, where each photo was shown for 7s. After each photo the participant rated from 1 to 3 how much they liked the photo. Once finished with all of the phots, the participants performs the backwards digit-spanning task, the ANT, and the PANAS assessments again. The participants came a week later to repeat the procedure but with complimentary photos.


### Research Environment:
In the researchers office/lab and in the city itself whether it is in the urban or natural environments.



### Data Collection  Approach: 
Data was collected using the PANAS, backwards digit-spanning task, and the ANT to provide a basis for measures. In so relative data to these measures were collected from the participants. 

## Overview of Results:
From looking at the Experiment 1’s results the values are both higher after the walks but the natural setting is higher in the Backward Span Measure. In experiment 2 the results closely followed for the Backward span measure. Additionally looking at the ANT measure effects there were some mixed results, although the authors hypothesized only the executive functions would decrease in the participants in the natural setting. The participants in the urban setting actually took longer on their executive and alerting levels. 

## Did study accomplish objective(s)?
Yes because experiment 1 as participants in the natural setting vastly improved their results after their walk vs the urban setting participants. Additionally in experiments 2 the authors repeated the studies in experiment 1 and the results were replicated. Lastly the ANT measures show that after the participants view photos of natural settings their executive cognitions increase. This is because directed attention involves executive tasks and can be restored through ART methods. _________________________________________________________


### Was Hypothesis proven? 
YES


# Conclusions/Discussion: 

### What were the conclusions of the study?:
“We can be confident that directed-attention mechanisms were restored in these studies because only portions of the ANT that involved directed attention were improved by interactions with nature.” 

-“Each of our experiments showed consistent improvement on the backwards digit-span task as a function of interactions with nature.”

-“Nature may also be more peaceful than other environments, thereby restoring directed-attention abilities. However, in Experiment 2, the environments were equally peaceful (i.e., both were in a quiet experimental room), yet only viewing pictures of nature produced cognitive improvements. We concur that there is an important peaceful element to nature, but believe that this peacefulness is driven by natural environments capturing attention modestly and limiting directed attention—not to sheer quiescence alone”

-“In sum, we have shown that simple and brief interactions with nature can produce marked increases in cognitive control. To consider the availability of nature as merely an amenity fails to recognize the vital importance of nature in effective cognitive functioning”




# Your perceptions of article:  


## What would you have changed about the methodology if anything and why ?
-The authors point out at the end other comparison methods that also restores the directed attention. I think a third and fourth set could of been looked at. For example adding someone who meditates after the first assessments, and assess them after they have meditated and see how the compared to those in nature

## Do the conclusion seem reasonable?
I agree that it does, because their results and research design didn’t have flaws. The researchers made sure to have truthful data to analyze when they were performing experiments. Additionally they performed the 2nd experiment different from actually being in nature and instead looking at a photo. This helps to see that the setting doesn’t matter but possibly the participants perception as participants for the natural and urban settings were just sitting in chairs looking at the respective photos. Either or it is the direct influence of Nature that seems to have a restorative effect and through their experiments and results this can be seen.





## Where would you apply the results of this study?
I would apply these results as standards to verify on another population with different methods like VR.
Can we validate this studies methodology using VR? From the photos I would assume yes.





## Additional comments about the article
I really liked how they had two experiments and the second was similar but different from experiment 1. Both though help define the problem at hand and give insight into the interworking of these phenomena. Lastly further comparison of restorative methods would be interesting to compare.
